### 📄 `README.md` – Final Version


# 📝 Task 4.4 – Mini Task Tracker

---

## 🎯 Objective

Your task is to build a **Task Tracker** using **DOM manipulation with JavaScript only**.

You will dynamically render the entire user interface into the `<main id="root">` element.

> ⚠️ **You are strictly prohibited from editing `index.html`.**
> All elements must be created and injected using JavaScript inside `App.js`.

---

## 🚫 Do Not Edit

```html
<main id="root"></main>
````

The `index.html` file has already been set up with a `<main id="root">` section.
**You may only write your code in `App.js`.**

---

## ✅ Requirements

Your Task Tracker must allow the user to:

1. **Add a task**

   * A text input field and button must be created with JavaScript.
   * The user types a task and clicks the button to add it.
   * **Prevent** adding empty tasks.

2. **Display tasks**

   * Tasks must appear as list items inside an unordered list (`<ul>`), created with JavaScript.
   * Each task must include:

     * A checkbox to mark it complete.
     * A “Delete” button to remove it.

3. **Mark tasks as complete**

   * When the checkbox is ticked, the task should appear crossed out (e.g., `line-through`).
   * The task must remain in the list, just visually updated.

4. **Delete tasks**

   * When the delete button is clicked, the task is removed from the list.

5. **Track remaining tasks**

   * Show a message at the bottom (e.g., “Tasks remaining: 3”) that updates as tasks are marked complete or deleted.

6. **Clear the input field**

   * After a task is successfully added, the input field should automatically clear.

## 🧠 Remember

* You may **not use frameworks or libraries** — pure JavaScript only.
* The layout and interface are yours to design (creativity encouraged), but must meet all functional requirements.
* If it’s not rendered with JavaScript, it doesn’t count!
